# STMFormer
Official implementation of STMFormer, a lightweight hybrid neural network for efficient sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). It features Spatio-Temporal Modulation (STM) attention, integrating ConvNets and Transformers for optimal accuracy-latency trade-off on mobile and edge devices.


The demo video is currently being prepared and will be released soon.
